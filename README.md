# Students Exam Score Analysis

## Project Overview
The "Students Exam Score Analysis" project delves into the factors influencing student performance and demographic composition within a class. Through comprehensive analysis, it uncovers insights into gender representation, transportation preferences, parental education impact, marital status influence, sports participation, and ethnic diversity among students. These findings provide valuable insights for educators, policymakers, and researchers in understanding student performance trends.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, our analysis reveals several noteworthy insights about student performance and demographics within the class:
- There's a higher representation of female students compared to males.
- Students predominantly favor school bus transportation over private modes.
- A positive relationship exists between parental education levels and student scores.
- Parental marital status and sports participation show no significant impact on academic performance.
- Gender differences are apparent, with females excelling in reading and writing, while males tend to outperform in math.
- A substantial portion of the student body belongs to ethnic group C, indicating a diverse student population.

These findings provide valuable insights into the dynamics of student performance and demographic composition within the class.
